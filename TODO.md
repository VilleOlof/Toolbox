# Davinki Toolbox TODO  

Internal TODO list for Davinki Toolbox.
And list of priorities.

## High Priority  

- Improve Dev Version (And make it public)  
- Export/Import AppSettings/Data/Settings *(Move to own folder?)*  
- Updater.js (Check for updates, and update source files)  
- Shutdown Plugin if Davinci Is closed (If possible, BG thread, ping pong?)  
- Update DataStore to be more like Settings in terms of data loading.  

## Other Stuff  

- Add more modules and hence, features  
- Quickly change themes?  
- Convert to SvelteKit? (Tauri would be best but doubt that will work with resolve)  
- Remake settings in more svelte like way?
