# Davinki Toolbox TODO  

Internal TODO list for Davinki Toolbox.
And list of priorities.

## High Priority  

- Update DataStore to be more like Settings in terms of data loading.  

## Other Stuff  

- Add more modules and hence, features  
- Quickly change themes?  
- Convert to SvelteKit? (Tauri would be best but doubt that will work with resolve)  
- Remake settings in more svelte like way?  
- Click and remove in the "Add Module" dropdown, when a module is placed already it becomes a "- ModuleName"
- Switch Reload Plugin next to github icon.

## Bugs

- Modules get stuck when dragging a module into a different sized containers drag corner
- Things get a bit weird when switching projects while having the moduleView open (or even just switching timeline in some cases)
    - Reload window upon project switch?
- Update isnt deleting "deleted" when updating (probably?)
- When module names are more than 15 characters and their name is cutoff in the add new list, it screws over the UpdateNav function in moduleHandler, (currently disabled the 15 char limit) (NavBar:59, ModuleHandler:248)
- Switch module_list and module_ignore to be .gitignored and be fully generated by the PrepareModules, and handle no files in toolbox.
- When importing the data, the moduleView layout doesnt get updated/load the modules.
