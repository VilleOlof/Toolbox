# Davinki Toolbox TODO  

Internal TODO list for Davinki Toolbox.
And list of priorities.

## High Priority  

- Update DataStore to be more like Settings in terms of data loading.  

## Other Stuff  

- Add more modules and hence, features  
- Quickly change themes?  
- Convert to SvelteKit? (Tauri would be best but doubt that will work with resolve)  
- Remake settings in more svelte like way?  
- Click and remove in the "Add Module" dropdown, when a module is placed already it becomes a "- ModuleName"
- Switch Reload Plugin next to github icon.

## Bugs

- Modules get stuck when dragging a module into a different sized containers drag corner
- Things get a bit weird when switching projects while having the moduleView open (or even just switching timeline in some cases)
    - Reload window upon project switch?
- Update isnt deleting "deleted" when updating (probably?)
